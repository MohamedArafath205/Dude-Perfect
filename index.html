<p><font color="#39FDE3" face="fira code semibold" size=4>You may have heard of Dude Perfect. They are 5 guys who have figured out to make crazy tricks shots and have fun for a living! Not bad, right? They are so good at what they do, they have one of the top 10 channels on YouTube. It all sounds really good.</p>
<br>
<p>But their real story is much deeper and much better. It is a story of goodness. A story of faith.  Of friendship. Of hard work. Of being yourself. Of passion. Of giving back.</p>
<br>
<p>Dude Perfect is made up of 5 best friends who met while in college at Texas A&M University. Their names are Coby and Cory Cotton, Garrett Hilbert, Cody Jones, and Tyler Toney.</p>
<br>
<p>At college, they became friends through their love of sports and their faith. They enjoyed spending time with each other so much that they all became roommates.</p>
<br>
<p>One day, in their backyard, they started to bet sandwiches that they could make a trick basketball shot. They started to take video of their crazy shots. Within one week, the video received over 200,000 views! Soon, they received a call from the TV show Good Morning America who wanted to interview them.</p>
<br>
<p>Here is their first video. The one that started everything!</p>

<br>
<p>As Dude Perfect started to catch on, they started to attract star athletes to shoot videos with them. And companies, like Nerf, to sponsor them.</p>
<br>
<p>Despite all of their fame and success, they have never taken their eyes off of their bigger mission to spread good around the world. Their message of the power of faith and friendship is at the heart of what they do.</p>
<br>
<p>This video shows the history of Dude Perfect and the values that drive them</p>
